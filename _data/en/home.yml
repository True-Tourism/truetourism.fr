  "Environmental Preservation": "We strive to limit our ecological impact, whether on carbon emissions or the tours themselves. We promote best practices, such as limiting the number of people per group or offering only soft mobility tours."
  "Heritage and Tradition Preservation": "Our goal is clear: to preserve our heritage from mass tourism, which tends to degrade and devalue local heritage due to poorly managed large tourist flows. The ultimate goal is simple: to preserve our heritage so that tourists can discover the same things in the same state of conservation, even in 50 or 100 years."
